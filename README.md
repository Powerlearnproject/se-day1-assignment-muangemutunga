Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


 1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)  
The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Conference in Germany. This marked a shift from informal programming practices to a structured engineering approach, addressing issues like the "software crisis"—where software became increasingly complex, unreliable, and difficult to maintain. This milestone emphasized the need for systematic development methodologies.  

 2. Introduction of Structured Programming (1970s)  
Structured programming, promoted by Edsger Dijkstra, introduced principles like modularity, control structures, and code readability. It replaced chaotic, unstructured coding with well-defined logical structures, improving software quality and maintainability. Languages like Pascal and C were developed during this period, supporting structured programming techniques.  

 3. The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001)  
In response to rigid traditional models like Waterfall, the Agile Manifesto was introduced in 2001. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, emphasized flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. This milestone transformed software engineering by promoting faster delivery, continuous feedback, and adaptability to changing requirements.  



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to design, develop, test, and maintain software. It consists of the following phases:  

1. Planning – Defines project goals, scope, and feasibility. Identifies resources, risks, and timelines to ensure a successful project.  

2. Requirements Analysis – Gathers and documents user needs and system requirements to create a clear blueprint for development.  

3. Design – Creates architectural and detailed designs, including system structure, user interfaces, and database models, ensuring a well-structured application.  

4. Implementation (Coding) – Developers write and integrate code using programming languages and frameworks to build the software.  

5. Testing – Identifies and fixes bugs by conducting functional, performance, and security testing to ensure software reliability and correctness.  

6. Deployment – Releases the software for users, either as a full launch or in phases, ensuring a smooth transition.  

7. Maintenance and Support – Updates, fixes bugs, and improves the software based on user feedback and evolving requirements.  



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

  

The Waterfall methodology follows a linear and sequential approach, where each phase (such as planning, design, implementation, testing, and deployment) must be completed before moving to the next. It is a structured model with well-defined phases, making it suitable for projects with clear and fixed requirements. However, it is less flexible, as changes are difficult and costly once development has started. Testing is performed at the end of the development cycle, and client involvement is limited after the initial requirements are gathered. Waterfall also emphasizes detailed documentation before development begins.  

The Agile methodology is iterative and flexible, allowing continuous development, testing, and feedback throughout the project. Instead of a strict sequence, Agile divides work into small cycles (sprints), where software is developed and tested incrementally. Agile allows frequent client involvement and quick adaptation to changing requirements. Unlike Waterfall, testing is done throughout the development process, ensuring early detection of issues. Agile focuses more on working software than on extensive documentation.  

 Appropriate Scenarios for Each Methodology  

The Waterfall methodology is best suited for projects with well-defined and stable requirements, such as developing a banking system where security, compliance, and extensive documentation are critical. Since changes are costly, a structured approach ensures reliability.  

On the other hand, the Agile methodology is ideal for projects where requirements are likely to change, such as developing a mobile app for a startup. Since features may evolve based on user feedback, Agile’s flexibility allows teams to make adjustments quickly and deliver updates frequently.
